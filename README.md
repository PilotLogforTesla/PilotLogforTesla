## (1) Start a new trip

- Before starting a new trip, you have to select an existing « itinerary » or create a new one: « Select » button, on the right of the Itinerary name display
- if you have several cars in your Tesla account, you have to select the one you use for this trip:  « Select » button, on the right of the Car name display
- when you start driving, use the « take-off » 🛫 button; this will record your trip departure location and related data

## (2) Record stops and starts

- if you make an intermediate stop (to recharge, for instance), or finish your trip, you push the « landing » 🛬 button
- when you re-start, you push the « take-off » 🛫 button

- for each stop/start, the following data is automatically recorded: time, address (latitude and longitude are stored in the background), mileage, battery %, external temperature
- for 🛫 , if preceded by a recharge, the recharge quantity (kWh) is recorded
- please note data collection may take 1-20 seconds 
- in rare cases, the app cannot connect to the car (no network zone, for instance); in such case, a screen will be displayed for manual data entry, pre-filled with the most probable values 

## (3) Edit a stop/start

- the latest recorded stop/start can be deleted (useful if you push the 🛬 or 🛫 button by mistake)
- each stop/start data can be edited manually (with the appropriate controls to retain data consistency)
- a note can be added (if a note is present, the 📝 indicator is displayed besides the stop address)
- if a recharge quantity (kWh) is present, the kWh unit cost (at the recharge station) can be recorded; this data, required to compute the trip « electricity cost » is the only one which is not collected automatically

## (4) Archive a trip

- push the « finish » 🏁button to archive the trip
- in order to be able to compute the trip « adjusted electricity cost », if the battery level at the end of the trip is below the battery level at the beginning, you will be prompted to enter the kWh unit cost for post trip recharge; if you do not know it, enter 0 or any value, you will be able to update it later (edit the last stop of the archived trip)

## (5) Trip « adjusted electricity cost » computation

- sum of the recharge costs along the trip
- if the battery level at the end of the trip is below the battery level at the beginning, addition of a virtual post trip recharge to reach the battery level of the beginning, at the post trip kWh unit cost entered when archiving the trip
- if the battery level at the end of the trip is above the battery level at the beginning, subtraction of the cost of the excess charge (vs the battery level at the beginning), at the kWh unit cost of the latest recharge
- the most practical way to get the trip cost information is to enter the kWh unit cost once the trip is archived; unit cost data is present at each starts ( 🛫 ) and at the last stop if you were prompted to enter post trip recharge cost when archiving the trip

## (6) Review an archived trip

- select « Archives »
- if no trip has been selected for display, the latest archived trip is displayed
- use the « Select » button (on the right of the Itinerary name), to select a trip (for a given itinerary and date); the list of archived trips can be sorted by time or by itinerary 
- in « archives », each stop/start data can be edited (with the appropriate controls)

## (7) Trip statistics

- the app displays trip statistics related to distance, battery usage or charge, duration, speed, outside temperature, electricity cost and cost per 100 miles (or km)

## (8) Trip map

- the « map » 🗺 button brings up a display of the trip route on the map (simple or satellite view)
- in order to build such a display, the gps position of your phone (in principle, same as the car…), is recorded every 50 meters while you drive (position recording is not active during a stop)
- in order to enable this feature, you have to allow the application to collect your position (requested at your first use of the application and possible to activate later in the Settings / Privacy / Location services menu on your iPhone)

## (9) Units and display preferences

- Distance unit, temperature unit and time display option (24-12) are as-defined in your Tesla

## (10) Additional features

- possibility to delete an itinerary or to edit its name (even once archived); this is done via the Itinerary « Select » button in the « new trip » context
- possibility to delete a trip which you do not need to keep in your archives; this is done via the Itinerary « Select » button in the « archives » context
- support of multiple cars in your Tesla account: Car « Select » button in the «  new trip » context
- for archives, support of cars no longer part of your Tesla account (but linked with archived trips)
- the « ? » button (top right), gives access to: Detailed Instructions, Change Log, write a review in App Store, link to Review in App Store, link to FAQ, email to the developper, Tesla account logout


## (11) Login to Tesla account

- the Tesla login screen is presented the first time you use the application or when the Tesla rules decide it is required 
- the app does NOT have access to your email/password data
- once logged you can use the app without re-logging (until Tesla decides that a new login is required)
- a « logout » button is available via « ? » / Assistance
